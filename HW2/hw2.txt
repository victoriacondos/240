\ExamInstrBox {
  You shall submit a zipped, \textbf{and only zipped}, archive of your homework
  directory, \texttt{hw2.zip}. The directory shall contain, at a minimum, the
  files \texttt{comp\_geo.h} and \texttt{comp\_geo.cc} in a directory named
  \texttt{hw2}.

  I will use my own makefile to make your \texttt{comp\_geo.cc} file.

I found a really great computational geometry library that stores circles and
rectangle in a very particular way--by keeping up with the points representing
each object. \\
\\
I require additional functionality for a project and am tasking you with the
development of the library.  \\
\\
%
I have included a couple tests demonstrating the interfaces. You should
definitely extend these tests. I will. You will also find a comp\_geo header and
source file. I provide those as an interface specification. \textbf{YOU} are
responsible for files you edit.\\
\\
%
The following functions should be implemented:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{CalcCircumference} 1.25 points
  \item \texttt{CalcCircleArea} 1.25 points
  \item \texttt{CalcPerimeter} 1.25 points
  \item \texttt{CalcRectangleArea} 1.25 points
  \item \texttt{CalcDistanceSquared} 1 point
  \item \texttt{CalcDistance} 1 point
\end{itemize}
The functions' descriptions can be found by reading the header. \\
\\
%
Late assignments will lose 25\% per day late, with no assignment begin accepted
after 4 days (100\% reduction in points). \\
\\
%
You will receive points for each test passed and one point for successful
compilation against the \texttt{test.cc} file for a total of eight (8) points.
Check your syllabus for further breakdown of grading.
